# DigitalPressAI

This project contains a Bun-based backend and frontend. To simplify running both
servers during development, use the provided `start.sh` script from the project
root:

```bash
./start.sh
```

The backend listens on `http://localhost:8080` and the frontend on
`http://localhost:3000`.
